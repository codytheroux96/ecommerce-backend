## Description
I built the back end for an e-commerce site using an already working exprees API and configured it to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database.
## Visuals

## Installation
For this program you will need the following packages and dependencies:
- Express
- MySQL 2
- Sequelize
- dotenv
## Usage
- After installing the necessary packages and dependencies you will load the schema and then run your seeds.js files to plant the seeds. You will run these files by entering the command "node seeds/index.js" into your terminal.
- You will start the server by using either nodemon or npm start
- This program does not have a live site so you can test all of your routes in Insomnia and build upon it if you'd like to.
